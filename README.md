## Individual Contributions

### Alexandr Hohlov
Wrote and implemented the Message, ScoreBoard and HighScore classes into the game and main menu. Added a random ball angle when the ball bounces off the player paddles. I also smoothed out the movement of the ball and paddle. 

For the README, I setup the format, and acquired the MIT license. For the wiki, I setup the wiki format, wrote the main page and file structure page. For the class description page I wrote the Game, Actor, Subclasses of Actor, HighScore and UML Diagram sections. 

### Salman
For the application, I added the boundaries and implemented the ball movement and its behaviour for interacting with the various actors. I also implemented the play/pause feature.

For the READEME, I provided two examples of how a user can extend the game. These examples were cosmetic or functional (affects gameplay). To show these extended features in action, i also added gif files demonstrating their implemeneted forms.

### Erin
For the code, I implemented the MainMenu and Button classes. The MainMenu class displays multiple buttons that let the players choose what they want the score limit to be. It also displays a button that lets them start the game. The buttons can be customized to run any function on any Pygame surface, so they can be reused in any project. For the Project Repository, I added the descriptions in the wiki for the MainMenu and Button classes. I also proofread and edited multiple pages on the wiki and README.
